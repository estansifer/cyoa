[start]

Lush, primary growth forest. Clean, breathable air. Vast wildnerness, seemingly
untouched by human -- or any -- hands.

You browse through the computer readings of the terrain immediately around your
ship, which speak of dense, tall woods irregularly interspersed with clearings
of light-red grass and clear rivers meandering through gently rolling hills.
You have just landed on Saffron V, the jewel of the remote and rarely visited
Saffron system, and wish to arm yourself with information before leaving the
security of your one-person craft. Rumors tell of a grand secret to be found on
this planet, and facts tell of explorers who visit and don't return. You have
prepared carefully for your trip, but so far there has been no hint of
something to be prepared /for/, and it seems you will not even need your
spacesuit. You step outside cautiously, but with optimism.

The air is thick with some not unpleasant odor to which you quickly acclimate.
The grass is springy and soft, and the forest around the clearing where you
landed your ship is open and inviting.

[[start2]] Head off into the forest.

[start2]

There is a small hill not far from the ship, and you decide to go through the
forest in that direction.

The forest is airy and well-lit. After 30 minutes of walking the hill does not
seem to be any closer than before. The gravity is slightly stronger than you
are used to, and while so far the walk has been easy, you are beginning to fear
that you have underestimated the difficulty that climbing the hill will pose.
You can still just barely see behind you the clearing that you came from, and
you think you can glimpse the reflective metal surface of your spacecraft from
between the trees but are not sure.

[[hill]] Continue towards the hill.
[[leave]] Return to the safety of your spacecraft.

[leave]

You return to the spacecraft with a mixture of disappointment and relief. You
wait inside, idly watching the controls and computer readings, but don't dare
to venture outside a second time. Eventually you grow bored and leave.

THE END

[hill]

Slowly the terrain begins to steepen, and on the low slopes of the hill the
wood thickens, obscuring your vision somewhat. After some time of walking in
silence you begin to grow tired and yearn to rest. Suddenly you run across a
narrow stream running approximately parallel to the direction of your path. You
think that you can probably cross the stream, but it is flowing quickly, and
you don't want to risk injury. It seems to be flowing from the top of the hill
that you are going towards, and following the stream would make it less likely
to lose your way.

[[rest]] Rest briefly besides the stream.
[[hill2]] Follow the stream further up the hill.

[rest]

You lie down by the stream and before long drift off to sleep. You wake up,
feeling much rested, though you do not think much time has passed.

You stand up and see that you are next to a stream, which seems to be flowing
from a nearby hill. You remember that you had been planning on climbing that
hill.

[[hill4]] Follow the stream further up the hill.
[[downhill]] Follow the stream downhill, back towards the spacecraft.

[hill2]

You continue up the hill, following the stream, which splits repeatedly and
eventually narrows and vanishes underground at some spring. The ground is steep
and the going has become very difficult, but you are too close to your
destination to stop. Weary and tired, you reach the top. It is now quite dark,
and you can only barely see the trees nearest to you. You have no choice but to
stop here until the morning.

You lie down on the ground, completely exhausted from the climb, and fall
asleep instantly.

[[hill3]] Sleep.

[hill4]

You continue up the hill, following the stream, which splits repeatedly and
eventually narrows and vanishes underground at some spring. The ground is steep
and the going has become difficult, but you seem to be nearing the top of the
hill. Weary and tired from the climb, you feel the ground leveling off as you
approach and reach the top. By now it has become dark, and the trees are almost
impossible to see in the vanishing light. You have no choice but to stay here
on the hill until the morning.

[[hill3]] Rest.

[hill3]

You wake and find yourself in almost complete darkness, with only a dim light
in the sky in one direction. You find your bag of supplies in arm's reach and
munch on some of the items inside as you watch the dawn and try to recollect
the events of yesterday. The ground gently slopes down away from you in all
directions, so you surmise that you successfully made it to the top of the hill
after all. In the dim morning light you make out the shapes of the trees around
you. They are larger than you remember, in fact enormous, towering far overhead
and with trunks too large to wrap your arms around.

Once the light is strong enough for you to navigate, you get up and examine
your surroundings. From the ground you can see only the forest extending in all
directions from you, and it is impossible to climb the trees to reach a better
vantage point.  You can find no indication of the direction you came from. You
head downhill, occasionally veering off in one direction or another in hopes of
running across your path from yesterday. Eventually you run across a narrow but
quick flowing stream; it doesn't look like the stream from yesterday, but you
can't be sure.

[[downhill]] Follow the stream downhill.

[downhill]

The stream repeatedly joins with other streams and gradually broadens until it
is far too wide to even attempt to cross it; if you attempted to wade it you'd
surely be swept away.

Abruptly you come to a ravine running perpendicular to your path. At the bottom
of the ravine, twice as deep as you are tall, you see deep crimson waters. It
is impossible to tell which direction the ravine waters are flowing, and
looking both left and right the ravine extends in each direction as far into
the forests as you can see from here. The stream itself flows until it pours
into the ravine in a waterfall agitating the water at the bottom.

At the juncture of the stream and the ravine, two great trees have fallen, one
crossing the ravine and one crossing the stream. The tree crossing the ravine
looks old and decayed; the tree crossing the water is slick and wet from the
mists of the waterfall below it; and neither looks safe to cross.

You are surprised to also see two figures at the juncture. They look thin and
gaunt, nearly skeletal, but strangely almost human despite the extra arms... or
whatever those appendages are. One looks vaguely masculine, the other perhaps
feminine. They are peering into the ravine.

They turn to face you. "Hello," says the woman. "Do you need help?"

They seem friendly.

"Well, I'm a bit lost. I'm looking for my spaceship... are you from around
here?" you say.

The man shakes his head. "Sorry, I'm afraid we're not. I'm from Saffron II. And
my companion here is from Saffron III. We're also a bit lost, actually."

The man continues. "We were walking along this ravine, on the other side, when
we saw this stream. We just crossed this old tree to get to this side of the
ravine so that we could follow the stream up the hill."

The woman interrupts. "I can't agree with that. We had been walking along the
ravine, on this side, when our path was blocked by this stream. We just crossed
this wet tree to get to this side of the stream so that we could continue
following the ravine."

You smile awkwardly and wait for further explanation from the two skeletal
figures.

The man shakes his head again. "I'm sorry about the confusion. People from
Saffron III always lie. However, don't worry, people from Saffron II always
tell the truth."

The woman laughs. "People from Saffron III always tell the truth. It's people
from Saffron II who always lie. You get used to it after a while."

The man points straight ahead, across the ravine. "When we were on the other
side of the ravine I think we saw a ship in a clearing in that direction. If
you cross the old tree and then continue straight ahead you will surely find it
quite soon."

The woman points along the ravine, across the stream. "We definitely saw an
abandoned ship in a clearing earlier, in that direction. If you cross the wet
tree and then continue along the ravine, you will find your ship. It is a long
walk but you will reach it before nightfall."

"Having a little trouble with /addition/? Want some help?" the woman says

The man joins in. "I have *two* arms!"

The woman says, "My companion is from Saffron *II*!"

The man says, "We've crossed exactly one of these *two* trees!"

The two continue laughing to themselves before regaining their composure.

[[conv-menu]] continue

[conv-ravine]

"Oh, no reason." the woman says. "There's nobody there."

You peer into the ravine suspiciously. You can see nothing more than the
sanguine waters of the ravine being churned up by the waterfall from the
stream.

[[conv-menu]] continue

[cross-old-tree]

You carefully walk across the old tree to get to the other side of the ravine.
The tree creaks and groans from your weight. You can hear the two figures
talking.

"I think the tree will hold," the woman says.

"We should do something," the man says.

The tree gives way and spills you into the ravine.

THE END

[cross-wet-tree]

You carefully crawl along the top of the wet tree to get to the other side of
the stream. You can barely see through the mists, and as you wipe the wet hair
out of your face you lose your grip with the other hand and fall into the
stream. You are powerless against the strong current which hurtles you into the
ravine, where your blood joins that of those before you.

THE END

[conv-win]

As you walk along the side of the ravine, you ignore the shouts of the two
figures behind you. "Wait! Come back!" one calls out. "We want to help you!"

The ravine wanders along in the forest unpredictably, but appears to be going
generally downhill. The ravine becomes shallower and narrower over time, and
eventually the waters within it vanish underground and the ravine itself peters
out. By this point, however, you have come within sight of a large clearing
nearby. You head quickly out into the clearing. It looks very much like the
clearing you left your spacecraft in... though perhaps a little smaller. And,
you can't help but noticing, this clearing doesn't have your spacecraft in it.
In fact, it is entirely devoid of anything of relevance what-so-ever.

You dejectedly walk around in the middle of the clearing when abruptly a
movement in the sky catches your eye. It vanishes before you can focus on it,
and just as suddenly there reappears a monstrous shape in the sky, silhouetted
against the star of the Saffron system.

The shape falls back to the ground, and then leaps into the air again, much
closer than before. You can glimpse several uprooted trees flung through the
air behind it. The form thunderously crashes to the ground in the clearing
before you. The ground beneath it buckles from the impact, with dirt and grass
flung about with tremendous force. One of the uprooted trees from before sails
on overhead to some distant landing behind you. Small foliage and dirt rain
down upon the clearing for some minutes.

The thing before you defies any sensible description. A hideous aggregation of
parts from every mythology and reality, with wings and arms and claws and
rotating eyeballs and fins attached in every way that couldn't possibly work.
It appears to be twice as large as it actually is, and each of its eyes seem to
be looking in a slightly different direction from the others. It exhales and
the trees at the edge of the clearing sway, some bending over. It inhales and
the trees right themselves again.

"Welcome," it says, "to my world." It carries itself with the air of a Sphinx.
It bows what you think is a head. You have trouble determining how it produces
sound.

You back away slightly. You feel like the thing is expecting a response.

"I... uh, I heard /rumors/-" you start.

"Yes! The rumors are completely true!" it exclaims into the sky. A tongue
rolled out one of its mouths as it talked, in a way that struck you as wholly
unreasonable for a tongue to do. "I AM THE LOGIC BEAST OF SAFFRON V!"

It feels as if the ground beneath rearranged itself at the force of the beast's
invocation, but you realize that it was just the experience of you being blown
to the edge of the clearing. You feel like this would be a poor time to mention
that none of the rumors had indicated anything about a Logic Beast, and that
rather more of them concerned the subject of boundless treasure.

"You have passed my first test," the beast says. "and so you receive a personal
welcome from me. Though of course," the beast looks sheepishly at itself, "this
is not my true form. I must take precautions. Guards! Seize the intruder!"

Your arms are suddenly grabbed from behind, and you are dragged to a cluster of
trees at the edge of the clearing. You feel chains placed on your wrists and
ankles, and see that that other end of the chains have been attached to the
trees near you. The chains are short and give you very little movement, so that
you struggle even to twist yourself around to see behind you. You are splayed
about uncomfortably with each limb in a separate direction.

"That's more like it," the beast says. "Now... /welcome/ to Saffron V." The
beast grins, displaying teeth as it did and losing several.

"As I'm sure you know from the rumors," it continues, "I expect each of my
visitors to challenge me with a riddle or puzzle or game of some sort. I will
of course give you a challenge of my own divising. It is not so difficult,
though the last person that came along had an awful lot of trouble with it! If
you are able to solve my challenge, then I will give you a reward greater than
any possible material reward. But if you fail, then you will receive some fate
suitable for those who fail. Is that clear?"

You pause for a while, digesting what the beast had told you. "I give you a
puzzle, and you give me a puzzle, and if I solve your puzzle then I receive
some amazing reward?"

"Exactly!" The beast stands on one leg and waves its other limbs about in what
must have been some kind of affirmation.

"And what if you're unable to solve my challenge?" you ask. You don't have a
puzzle in mind yet but hopefully would be able to think of one soon.

"Hmm? Ridiculous!" the beast grunts.

"I have a very difficult one for you," you press.

The beast seems intrigued and pleased, but conversely proud. "It has never
happened before. I have always solved every puzzle I have been given."

"There's always a first," you insist.

"Maybe," the beast says, thinking quietly. "Very well. If I am unable to render
unto you the correct answer to your puzzle, then I will give you any one thing
you ask for."

"Agreed," you say.

"Yes. Now then!" the beast continues with sudden conviction. "We shall exchange
challenges. As my guest on this planet, you may go first."

[[choose puzzle]] continue

[choose puzzle]

You think for a while about what challenge you wish to pose the beast.

"What is your challenge?" the beast says.

[[number    ]] Say, "I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 63..."
[[coins     ]] Say, "There are 13 coins, one of which is counterfeit..."
[[random    ]] Say, "Before you are three people, one of whom answers randomly..."
[[chocolate ]] Say, "There are 12 pieces of chocolate, one of which is poisoned..."
[[drops     ]] Say, "You want to know how high you can drop a chair..."

[number]

You announce your challenge.

"I'm thinking of a whole number from 1 to 63. You need to guess my number using
at most 6 guesses. After each wrong guess, I will tell you whether your guess
was too low or too high."

The beast agrees to the rules, nodding its barbed tail.

"Once you've decided upon your number, I can begin. Ready?" the beast says.

[coins]

You announce your challenge.

"There are 13 coins, one of which is counterfeit. Each of the 12 genuine coins
weighs the same amount, but the counterfeit coin weighs a different amount from
the others. You also have an extra weight, which weighs the same amount as a
genuine coin. Lastly, you have a balance which allows you to see which of two
weights is heavier. You may use the balance at most three times, after which
you must tell me which coin is counterfeit and whether it is heavier or lighter
than a genuine coin."

The beast agrees to the rules, rubbing its mouths in assent.

"I number the coins 1 through 13, and call the weight W. Once you've decided
which coin is counterfeit and whether it is heavier or lighter I can begin
solving the puzzle, and announce the counterfeit coin at the end. Ready?" the
beast says.

You may ask two yes-no questions to whomever you choose (possibly different
people each time) and must determine who the two truth-tellers are."

dropping a chair from the first floor does not destroy it, but that dropping it
from the 28th floor does destroy it. Using only the three chairs, you must
determine what is the highest floor a chair can be dropped from without
destroying it.

[victory]

The beast looks at you in reverie and makes no sound.

"Go on," you press, "what is the number I am thinking of? You have one guess
left."

"How did you know... that I cannot say that number?" the beast mutters under
its breath.

You continue, restraining your voice. "So can you give me the correct answer to
my challenge?"

The beast looks away. One by one it folds up its wings and stows them under
some large flaps covered in scales. It breathes softly, the trees rocking back
and forth as it did. "No. I cannot fathom how you did it, but you have
outwitted me."

"So I can have any one thing I ask for? I request safe escort back to my
spaceship and off this planet," you say.

"Very well. Your spaceship is quite a long ways off in that direction. How you
managed to get so terribly lost in the first place is quite beyond me. Guards!
Escort the visitor back to the spaceship. And don't tell any more of your
ludicrous lies on the way back."

The chains are unbound from you and the two skeletal figures from before begin
to lead you the way back towards your ship.

"One more thing," the beast says, "take this as a trophy for your victory." It
rips off one of its scales and tosses it to your feet. The scale glistens like
a flickering fire in the sunlight. The colors twist and shift like a hologram
as the scale is tilted. You see the tiny words "Logic Beast of Saffron V"
etched up and down every surface of the scale. You can barely lift it.

You feel a sudden gust of wind as the beast leaps into the air once more,
raising up an enormous cloud of dirt and grass that obscures the star of the
Saffron system. The earth shakes as the beast lands in some distant location,
and one last time you see the beast hurtling through the air before vanishing
from sight.

THE END

[correct number]

"I have solved your challenge, have I not?" the beast says with evident
satisfaction.

It does not wait for a response from you before continuing.

"Now that I have solved your puzzle, you must solve one of mine. If you
succeed, I shall reward you beyond your wildest imagination. If you fail, you
shall suffer greatly, like all those who have failed before you."

The beast nears you and looks you straight in the eyes.

"But I have confidence in you. I think you are not like the others, who came
before. I believe that maybe, you are the one!"

The beast regains its composure and arhythmically paces up and down before you,
scratching the nose on its belly as if deep in thought.

"Anyhow, here is my puzzle. It is surely not too difficult for you. I just hope
that you do not find it so easy that you do not even enjoy solving it.

I gather two of my friends before me, whose names are P------ and S--. I
announce to them that I have secretly chosen two integers A and B, such that
1 < A <= B. I announce further that I will tell P------ the product A * B and I
will tell S-- the sum A + B. After I have confidentially told P------ the value
of A * B and confidentially told S-- the value of A + B, the two of them get
together and have a conversation.

    S--    : You do not have enough information to know A and B.
    P------: Now I know the values of A and B.
    S--    : Now I know them, too.

What are the values of A and B? There may be multiple answers, only one is
necessary."

You are dumbstruck.

[[puzzle response]] continue

[puzzle response]

The beast looks at you expectantly.

"What are your thoughts? I imagine you must have solved so easy a puzzle by
now."

[[repeat    ]] Say, "Can you repeat the puzzle again?"
[[hint      ]] Say, "Um... can I have a hint?"
[[solve1    ]] Say, "I know an answer to the puzzle."
[[no answer ]] Say, "The puzzle has no valid solution."
[[stall1    ]] Stall for time as you methodically search for weaknesses
        in the chains binding you.

[repeat]

The beast repeats the puzzle.

"I gather two of my friends before me, whose names are P------ and S--. I

[[puzzle response]] continue

[hint]

The beast pauses in its awkward pacing and gives you a puzzled look. One of its
ears unfolds in surprise.

"A... hint?" it says. "What do you mean?"

[[puzzle response]] Say, "Ummm... never mind, I think I can solve the puzzle."
[[small hint]] Say, "I was having just a little trouble with the puzzle and
        thought that with a tiny bit of help I would be able to solve it."
[[big hint  ]] Say, "I'm afraid I'm completely lost with the puzzle and I'm
        not really sure where to begin with it."
[[define hint]] Say, "A 'hint' is an additional piece of information which
        narrows down the possible answer choices."

[small hint]

The beast folds its ear back up and looks at you more closely. "You don't mean
that my puzzle is too difficult for you, do you?"

"Yes --  I mean, well, I am sure I would have no trouble solving it by myself,
but I might need a lot of time, and I thought that maybe with just a little
clue I would not need so much time; or maybe I should just keep thinking about
it and give you the answer tomorrow......?"

The beast was no longer paying attention to what you were saying. It sighs and
lays down on the grass, neatly double-folding its arms beneath it to do so. It
stares off into space and speaks, as if to itself deep in thought.

"I was told that, surely this one was different from the others! This visitor
showed much promise, much potential. Bright, intelligent, they told me. And I
thought that maybe this time they were right. But... so close, but not quite
there. I'm... sorry."

The beast dispassionately speaks to someone you can not see behind you.
"Guards, deal with the intruder in the usual way. And do not speak to me of
this one again."

THE END

[big hint]

The beast scrapes its ears against a tree in disappointment. "Just like the
others!" it sighs, and walks away without looking back, leaving you to vainly
contend against the chains tying you in place.

THE END

[define hint]

The beast looks bewildered. "'Additional piece of information which narrows
down the possible answer choices'? But that doesn't make any sense! The puzzle
already contains within itself a complete set of information sufficient to
narrow down the possible answers to a single choice -- the correct answer.
Giving you the puzzle gives you the exact same information as had I given you
the answer. The idea of 'additional information' which would narrow down the
possible answers even further makes no sense at all, unless you mean to narrow
down the possible answers to none at all, which would make the puzzle
unsolvable! Do you agree?"

You are beginning to feel like you have made a mistake.

[[hint agree]] Say, "Yes."
[[hint disagree]] Say, "No."

[hint agree]

The beast looks at you and tenses its thin wings. "Right. It appears that you
want me to add further information to my puzzle to make it impossible. I'm
afraid we don't do that kind of thing here."

The beast speaks to the unseen guards behind you. "Place the prisoner on the
next ship to Saffron IV to be with other... illogical beasts. Next time only
notify me when you've found someone worthy."

THE END

[hint disagree]

The beast's bill quacks madly in dismay as it tries to grasp your response.

"What?! How can you disagree? My reasoning is sound and irrefutable. If you
cannot see that, then you must be blind to all thought and reason. Never mind,
there is no sense in talking with you, your words will only fill my head with
contradictions and wrong conclusions. Guards, have the prisoner executed this
instant!"

THE END

[solve1]

"Excellent! I am very pleased. What is the solution?" the beast asks. Its eyes
hum up and down with anticipation.

[[solve2]] Say, "A is 4 and B is 13."

[solve2]

"That is completely correct! Well done." the beast says.

You momentarily feel very pleased with yourself. Then the beast looks at you
and says, "There is just one thing missing. The solution is not a /real/
solution without an unassailable argument justifying it as correct. What is
your reasoning that lead you to that answer?"

[[solve3]] Say, "Let X be the value of A + B and Y be the value of A * B.
        Then S-- knows the value of X and P------ knows the value of Y. Let us
        label the three given facts as {1}, {2}, and {3}:
            {1} Given X, we know that Y does not determine A and B.
            {2} Given {1} and Y, we know A and B.
            {3} Given {2} and X, we know A and B.
        Now we claim that A = 4 and B = 13 is consistent with all three facts
        {1}, {2}, and {3}.

        First, consider for what values of Y = A * B it is possible to uniquely
        determine the values of A and B without further information. Suppose
        for now that Y is even and not a power of two; write Y = 2 * M. If
        furthermore M is not prime, then knowing Y is not sufficient to
        uniquely determine the factorization Y = A * B.

        Now consider for a moment some value of X that is odd and such that
        X - 2 is not prime. Then for every possible summation X = C + D, one of
        C and D is even and the other odd, so their product C * D is even and
        not a power of two, and furthermore if C is 2 then D is not prime, so
        by the previous paragraph we can conclude:
            Statement {1} is true for odd values of X such that X - 2 is not
            prime.
        In particular, as
            11 =  2 +  9
            17 =  2 + 15
            23 =  2 + 21
            27 =  2 + 25
            35 =  2 + 33
            37 =  2 + 35,
        and none of 9, 15, 21, 25, 33, and 35 are prime, therefore statement
        {1} holds for X = 11, 17, 23, 27, 35, and 37.

        Consider some value of Y...."

[[guessed]] Say, "I guessed?"

[solve3]

The beast listens attentively.

[[solve4]] Continue, "Consider some value of Y for which we want to know
        whether statement {2} is true. If we can exhibit two different
        factorizations Y = C * D such that {1} holds for both values of C + D,
        then we have no way of distinguishing which factorization of Y might be
        correct, so statement {2} must be false for such values of Y.

        In particular, consider that
            30 =  2 * 15 =  5 *  6  but  2 + 15 = 17,  5 +  6 = 11
            42 =  3 * 14 =  2 * 21  but  3 + 14 = 17,  2 + 21 = 23
            60 =  5 * 12 =  3 * 20  but  5 + 12 = 17,  3 + 20 = 23
            66 =  6 * 11 =  2 * 33  but  6 + 11 = 17,  2 + 33 = 35
            70 =  7 * 10 =  2 * 35  but  7 + 10 = 17,  2 + 35 = 37
            72 =  8 *  9 =  3 * 24  but  8 +  9 = 17,  3 + 24 = 27
        and statement {1} is true for X = 11, 17, 23, 27, 35, and 37. Therefore
        we can conclude that statement {2} is false for Y = 30, 42, 60, 66, 70,
        and 72.

        Now we claim that statement {3} holds for X = 4 + 13 = 17. Given this
        value of X, we know that X = A + B for some A and B such as:
            X = 17 =  2 + 15,       Y =  2 * 15 = 30;
            X = 17 =  3 + 14,       Y =  3 * 14 = 42;
            X = 17 =  4 + 13,       Y =  4 * 13 = 52;
            X = 17 =  5 + 12,       Y =  5 * 12 = 60;
            X = 17 =  6 + 11,       Y =  6 * 11 = 66;
            X = 17 =  7 + 10,       Y =  7 * 10 = 70; or
            X = 17 =  8 +  9,       Y =  8 *  9 = 72.
        Now we just saw that statement {2} is false for each of those values of
        Y except possibly for Y = 52. Therefore, given statement {2}, we can
        conclude that A = 4, B = 13. Thus we have shown that, given both X = 17
        and statement {2}, we can deduce the values of A and B; therefore
        statement {3} is true for X = 17.

        We already saw that statement {1} holds for X = 17, so all that remains
        to be shown is that statement {2} holds for Y = 52. First we observe
        that...."

[solve4]

The beast continues listening.

[[solve5]] Continue, "First we observe that if Y = 115, then knowing
        only the value of Y is sufficient information to deduce A and B,
        because 115 = 5 * 23 is a product of two primes, so we must have A = 5
        and B = 23 (there is no other possible factorization).

        Now it follows that statement {1} is false for X = 28, for knowing only
        that X = 28 we cannot eliminate the possibility that
            X = 28 =  5 + 23,       Y =  5 * 23 = 115,
        in which case it is possible that Y does determine A and B by itself.

        Now to show that statement {2} holds for Y = 52, consider every
        possible factorization of Y = 52 = C * D. They are
            Y = 52 =  2 * 26,       X =  2 + 26 = 28; or
            Y = 52 =  4 * 13,       X =  4 + 13 = 17.
        Therefore, given that statement {1} is true and that Y = 52, we would
        be able to eliminate the possibility that X = 28 (as statement {1} is
        false for 28) and conclude that A = 4 and B = 13. Therefore the values
        of A and B would be uniquely determined, and so statement {2} holds for
        Y = 52. This concludes our demonstration that A = 4 and B = 13 is a
        valid solution to the puzzle."

[solve5]

The beast pauses for a moment after the completion of your explanation.

"Finally!" the beast cries with a voice of unfettered bliss. "I have found the
one I have been looking for for so long!"

It continues. "I have solved your puzzle, and you have solved mine. Finally I
have found a being that shares my love of puzzles and logic and will truly
understand who I am. We may look very different, but deep down we are the same,
two like beings searching for each other across a universe filled only with
beings of illogic and unreason."

You feel uncomfortable.

"Now, I can give you the reward I have promised you... me!" The beast's gills
rhythmically sway.

You continue to feel uncomfortable.

"Oh, wait, sorry, I'm still in this ridiculous costume!" The beast begins to
remove one of its fake plastic heads, to reveal....

[[solve6]] continue

[solve6]

...to reveal a yet more hideous beast!

"See! I am truly beautiful!" the beast cries. "Guards, remove these terrible
chains from the visitor. We are to be wed at once!"

Your chains are removed but already you can feel the invisible chain of
matrimony holding you fast.

You may not have outwitted the Logic Beast of Saffron V, but with time you come
to accept your ending as some form of a victory. As you live out the remainder
of your life on Saffron V, you can't help but wonder if there was something
else you could have done!

THE END

[guessed]

"That is... absurd." The beast's eyebrows meander about its face in confusion.
"Are you serious? Do you really have no idea what makes your solution correct?"

You nod.

"Well... I do not understand who you are, but clearly you are not a thing of
logic. Guards, flay and dissect this organism. I want the brain preserved so
that I may study it later."

THE END

[no answer]

"There is no solution? Surely I did not hear you correctly?" the beast says.

[[puzzle response]] Say, "Sorry, I must have mispoken."
[[no answer2]] Say, "I am sure, there is no solution."

[no answer2]

The beast narrows its eyes at you so closely that you fear its face will split
in half.

"That is incorrect," the beast says, "there is a solution to the puzzle. But I
fear that any discussion further of this with you is a waste of my time. I
cannot fathom a creature who can proclaim a falsehood with complete certainty.
And neither do I wish to. Guards! Dismember the intruder and fertilize the
forest with the parts."

THE END

[stall1]

You say, "I've really been enjoying the puzzles, but I'm afraid I haven't
gotten to know you very well, and would very much like it if you could tell me
a little about yourself."

The beast's eyes sparkle, one bursting in flames. "Why! You're quite right. I'm
sorry, I've completely forgotten my manners."

The beast begins to pace back and forth, staring mostly at the ground with
occasional, unfocused glances at you. You start to feel along the chain
attached to your left arm, checking every link that you can reach for
weaknesses.

"I've been here on Saffron V for so long," the beast started, "and so rarely
met people as interested in puzzles as yourself, that it completely passed my
mind to tell you anything at all about me. I haven't always been on Saffron V,
you see. My earliest memories are of Saffron II -- a much warmer planet to be
sure, but with just the same beautiful reds and oranges. Orbits the same star,
after all!"

[[stall2]] Check the chain attached to your right arm.

[stall2]

Slowly you start feeling along the chain attached to your right arm.

The beast continues uninterrupted. "I can still remember how I first became
interested in logic and puzzles. There had been a traveler, much like yourself,
from a faraway system whose name I still don't know. I was quite young at the
time, and the traveler had told me my very first logic puzzle. It is not a
challenging puzzle, but I treasure it in my memory. I'm sure you'd love to hear
it, you've been a very good listener."

[[stall3]] Check the chain attached to your left leg.

[stall3]

By balancing carefully on your right foot and sticking your left high in the
air, you can just barely reach the chain with your left hand. You swing your
right arm about for balance as you start to feel along the chain.

"There is a king inspecting his retinue of elite soldiers, and he wants them to
march in equal rows for the inspection. First he asks the soldiers to march in
rows of 5, but after forming the rows they find that there is one soldier left
over who does not fit into any row. Then he asks the soldiers to march in rows
of 7, but this time there are five soldiers left over after they form the rows.
Finally in desparation he asks the soldiers to march in pairs, but even then
there is a soldier that is left unpaired! The question is, what is the fewest
number of soldiers that the king could have had in his retinue?"

[[stall4]] Check the chain attached to your right leg.

[stall4]

You try to repeat the same acrobatics with the other side, but manage to wrench
your left ankle painfully. To take as much weight as possible off of your left
foot, you pull down very hard with your left hand, thus putting some of your
weight on that chain. Meanwhile you feel along the chain attached to your right
leg.

"Yes, yes, don't laugh, of course there is no need to answer such a trivial
question. I did not mean to impugn your intelligence by suggesting otherwise!
None-the-less, this puzzle is very dear to me. I hold the answer to that puzzle
in sacred memory of the traveler who taught it to me, and never will say that
number until I meet another being who understands me so well."

All four chains appear to be sound.

[[stall5]] Didn't you have a knife in your back pants pocket?

[stall5]

You can just barely reach your back pants pocket with your elbows and feel the
the bulge of the knife, but can't get a strong enough grip to remove it.
Instead you bring your feet as close together as possible, crouch down a bit,
and jump as high as you can to try to launch the knife from your pocket.

"But enough of these silly childhood things! Really, I didn't mean to bore you
with silly stories of my youth and vows I made so many ages ago. I'm sure you'd
much rather hear about Saffron V. That is, after all, why you came to visit,
and it's not like you've had much of a chance to see the sights from where you
are now! However you can already get a decent idea of the place from what you
can see here. Much of the planet is forested, like here, though I must say that
this is a particularly fine forest area where we are now. Well-fertilized, you
might say."

The knife comes out of your pocket and lands somewhere behind you.

[[stall6]] Bend over backwards and look for the knife.

[stall6]

You feel the rush of blood to your head as you bend over as far backwards as
you can reach, still barely touching the ground with the tips of your toes. A
confusing visage of upside-down trees growing downwards into the sky enters
your eyes as you dizzily search for a knife on the ground above you somewhere.
You tuck your hands under your knees to steady yourself.

"Pretty much the whole place is land, with a few large lakes in the distant
south. I can't stand water worlds... all the perfectly flat water, extending as
far as you can imagine, it is just too overwhelming to be faced with the whole
planet all at once in this way, just too enormous. To know that through the
whole thing there is no variation, no complexity, it is like seeing the entire
planet in a single glance. It becomes very large and very small all at once,
which just isn't right for a planet. I went to Saffron IV once -- it is a water
world, of course -- and had to leave almost as soon as I arrived. Not a single
spot of land to give it some spice or flavor."

You spot the knife, just in reach of your left foot.

[[stall7]] Nudge the knife closer so you can pick it up.

[stall7]

You try to right yourself again but find that your left arm remains stuck
underneath your left leg. Jumping about madly and tugging your arms around you
eventually free your limbs from each other, but find that in defiance of all
plausible topology you have managed to entagle the chains for your left leg and
left arm. You can no longer reach the knife with your left leg.

"Saffron V itself is my favorite in the Saffron system. The star is just the
right brightness here, and the complex interweaving of grasslands and forests
that encircle the planet create the most intricate fractal pattern. Sometimes I
just love to gallop for days at a time (rolling down the hills of course) to
watch the scenery go by."

To extend your reach with your right leg, you stick your left foot in the air
above your head, with your left arm obliged to wrap around your left leg due to
the entangled chains. You can now just barely reach the knife with your right
foot, but you don't have enough strength and leverage to turn your knee in the
necessary direction all the way. To maximize your range-of-motion, you
violently swing your right foot back and forth in regular oscillations, with
your right arm flailing in synchrony. With a great outpouring of force you just
manage to barely tap the knife, nudging it slightly further away.

[[stall8]] Rip off a pants leg to use as a whip to grab the knife.

[stall8]

Starting from a torn spot on the right knee of your pants, you manage to rip
apart a sizeable portion of the fabric uselessly, before eventually removing a
large chunk from your knee to your ankle. You take off your right shoe with
comparatively little difficulty and begin trying to thread the torn portion of
the pants down your leg and through the chain links so that you can retrieve
it.

"To be honest, actually, I have never left the Saffron system. I have heard
tales of these places, of planets five times the size of Saffron VI and made
almost all of air, of white stars and strange-looking creatures that live on
planets orbiting them! I am not sure that I could bear these places, and I am
at least quite happy here. I am content, at least, to hear the occasional story
of far flung places from those who wander into (and less often, out of) my
home. Speaking of which, I have been talking for quite a while, and I am sure
that you -- what the hell are you doing?"

The beast suddenly stops talking and stares motionless at you.

You look up from your task and freeze. Sweat from the intense concentration
drips down your face; your right hand still desparately clings on to a thread
of fabric that you had managed to work through the chain link. Half of your
pants are destroyed, and shredded fabric litters the ground around you. Your
left leg and arm dangle helplessly in the air above your head. The chains
remain twisted about your limbs and body in a senseless confusion.

"I'm, uhhh, trying to get /that/." You try to gesture with your head at your
knife, which lies somewhere in the grass on the ground behind you.

The beast continues to stare. "You're sick, you know. You can do whatever you
want, but I don't have to be here to see it," it says, and backs away from you,
leaving you entangled in your chains.

THE END

[impossible]

The beast's eyes quiver furiously, no longer focusing on anything. Its whole
face is filled with rage as its mind tries to reconcile the facts set before
it. Its thin vestigial wing flaps, three on its left and two on its right,
spasmatically slam up and down, producing a horrifying chorus of squelches as
they slap against its belly. Its ear claw rakes against the ground in agony.
The whole body of the beast shudders uncontrollably. Its non-speaking mouth
sputters, shedding teeth. A giant intake of breath swells the beast to almost
twice its ordinary size.

                    IMPOSSIBLE!!!

the beast expels deafeningly. Distant trees are felled in response.

The mashing, gnashing, bashing beast jumps at you and tears you limb from limb
with its teeth.

THE END

[start]
You find yourself in a pub filled with characters matching every size, color,
and description.

In the rear of the pub there is an open doorway leading into a semi-private
room labeled with a simple wooden plaque carved with the inscription:
                Adventures

You enter the room, crouching to pass through the short doorway. A stern
looking woman, small and otherwise totally nondescript, is the only occupant.
She glances at you with disdain and returns to doing nothing particular.

"Umm... hello?" you say, nervously poised just inside the doorway.

"You're here for an adventure?" she says with a hint of skepticism.

"Yes, I was told... well... I'm not sure what kind of adventure is right for
me. Can you suggest something?"

"Ha! I can't just /give/ you an adventure. Your adventure will be of your own
making. You must
                CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
."

[[games/help    |]] Say, "I've never been on an adventure before, what do I do?"
[[games/logic   |]] Say, "I will outwit the Logic Beast of Saffron V!"
